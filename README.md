A comprehensive guide to the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), mapping fundamental theories to advanced C++ implementation concepts. This repository serves as a structured roadmap for mastering OOP.

## 🏛️ The Four Pillars of OOP

### 1. Encapsulation 🛡️
The process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit called a **Class**, while restricting direct access to some components.
* **Goal:** Data protection and integrity (Information Hiding).
* **Key Concepts:** `Access Modifiers`, `Constructors`, `Destructors`, and `this pointer`.



---

### 2. Abstraction ☁️
Focusing on "what" an object does rather than "how" it does it. It hides implementation details and shows only the necessary interface.
* **Goal:** Reducing complexity and separating design from implementation.
* **Key Concepts:** `Abstract Classes` and `Pure Virtual Functions`.



---

### 3. Inheritance 🧬
A mechanism where a new class (Child) acquires properties and behaviors from an existing class (Parent).
* **Goal:** Code Reusability and hierarchical classification.
* **Key Concepts:** `Base & Derived Classes`, `Protected Access`, and `Inheritance Modes`.



---

### 4. Polymorphism 🎭
The ability of an object or function to take on multiple forms, allowing a single interface to represent different underlying types.
* **Goal:** Flexibility and extensibility.
* **Key Concepts:** `Virtual Functions` (Runtime) and `Function/Operator Overloading` (Compile-time).

## 🛠️ Advanced Utilities & Concepts

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Static Members** | Shared data/functions across all instances of a class. |
| **Friend Functions** | Non-member functions granted access to private members. |
| **Exception Handling** | Robust error management using `try`, `throw`, and `catch`. |
| **Templates** | Writing generic and reusable code for any data type. |
