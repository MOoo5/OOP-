A comprehensive guide to the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), mapping fundamental theories to advanced C++ implementation concepts. This repository serves as a structured roadmap for mastering OOP.

## 🏛️ The Four Pillars of OOP

### 1. Encapsulation 🛡️
The process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit called a **Class**, while restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
* **Goal:** Data protection and security (Information Hiding).
* **Key Concepts:**
    * `Access Modifiers`: Using `private`, `protected`, and `public`.
    * `Constructors & Destructors`: Controlling object lifecycle.
    * `Getters & Setters`: Mediating access to private data.
    * `this pointer`: Identifying the current object instance.



---

### 2. Abstraction ☁️
Focusing on "what" an object does rather than "how" it does it. It hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary interface to the user.
* **Goal:** Reducing complexity and separating design from implementation.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * `Abstract Classes`: Blueprints that cannot be instantiated.
    * `Pure Virtual Functions`: Forcing derived classes to implement specific logic.
    * `Header Files (.h)` vs `Implementation Files (.cpp)`.



---

### 3. Inheritance 🧬
A mechanism where a new class (Child/Derived) acquires the properties and behaviors of an existing class (Parent/Base).
* **Goal:** Code Reusability and hierarchical classification.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * `Base & Derived Classes`: Establishing "is-a" relationships.
    * `Protected Access`: Allowing child classes to access parent data.
    * `Modes of Inheritance`: Public, Private, and Protected inheritance.



---

### 4. Polymorphism 🎭
The ability of an object or function to take on multiple forms. It allows a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).
* **Goal:** Flexibility and extensibility.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * `Function/Operator Overloading`: Compile-time polymorphism.
    * `Virtual Functions`: Runtime polymorphism (Dynamic Binding).
    * `Templates`: Writing generic code for any data type.

## 🛠️ Advanced Utilities & Concepts

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Static Members** | Shared data/functions across all instances of a class. |
| **Friend Functions** | Non-member functions granted access to private members. |
| **Exception Handling** | Robust error management using `try`, `throw`, and `catch`. |
| **Constant Members** | Ensuring functions do not modify the object's state. |
